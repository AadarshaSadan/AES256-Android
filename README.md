What is the best encryption algorithm? 

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a well-known encryption technique that is utilized by the US government and other organizations.
AES supports 192- and 256-bit keys for very demanding encryption tasks, despite being incredibly efficient in 128-bit form.

For encryption and decryption, all symmetric encryption ciphers use the same key. In this case, both the sender and the receiver must use the same key. Using cryptographic keys of 128-, 192-, or 256-bits, each encrypts and decrypts 128-bit data in chunks. 

Plain text is translated into Cipher before being produced into Cipher text bits of 128, 192, and 256.


We use two seperate classs for encryption and decryption in the code.
